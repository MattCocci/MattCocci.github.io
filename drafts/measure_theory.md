Having just finished up a class on measure theory and measure integration, I figured I'd better put down what I learned somewhere, before the topic moves into a spacious new apartment next to Stokes' Theorem, Complex Analysis, and most Physics in my mind's "Building of Things Learned and Forgotten."

So, here's the basic idea of everything I learned, in one sentence. In Riemann integration, you divide up the _domain_; in measure integration, you divide up the _range_.

In retrospect, this is a pretty obvious alternative approach to try, but, then again, it's not at all clear why it should work as well as Riemann integration (or even at all). So let's be more explicit about what it actually entails.
