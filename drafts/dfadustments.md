If you took undergraduate statistics class, your professor probably wrote up on the board the formula for the sample variance:

$$ \hat{sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum^n_{i=1} (y_i - \bar{y})^2 $$

At this point, it's usually someone in the front row who points out, "Professor, the book has $1/(n-1)$ not $1/n$. Which is it?"  

Now at this point, the professor probably does the sensible thing, saying "Well, in practice it doesn't really matter.  And the theory is beyond where we are right now, so just pick one."

Most students will be content with that, but others--like myself--will probably obsess a bit about that really (admittely) minor distinction.  In this post, I'll talk about
- Where it comes from--which will require touching on some really important concepts in state.
- Why your professor was right; it doesn't really matter.
