'Hugely Important Things that I Never Knew Existed'

This marks the first post in what may be an ongoing series---'Hugely Important Things that I Never Knew Existed.' You probably know what I mean by this: Topics that were maybe too advanced or expansive to cover in an intro or undergrad course, despite being Hugely Important. Then, as soon as you start digging a little deeper or look at more advanced work, that thing is everywhere. It's written off in the beginning of papers as 'background material'; it generalizes all these particular cases you learned instead; it's crocheted on your mother's throw pillows in the guest bedroom. (The really nice one that never gets used.)

And for me, thes Hugely Important Things included state space models, principal component analysis, dynamic factor models, etc. So that's what this series is going to be about. Those Things, why they are so Hugely Important, and (maybe) why we should know about them.

State Space Models:
- Modeled the unobserved.
- Handling missing observations.
- Generalization of time series.
- Two levels of error and innovations.
- Imposing structural models.
