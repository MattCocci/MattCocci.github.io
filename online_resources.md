### Online Resources

Below are some resources I've used, which are (so far as I can tell) freely posted for you to use.  Be sure to follow the links below to the authors' own sites as well.  In general, I've found that searching the home pages of well-known academics often leads to some great links and course materials, so try that if this proves insufficient.

* Video Lectures and Online Classes

### My Notes

And now for my contribution, which is a repo holding the notes I've taken for certain classes. Included are both the $\LaTeX$ code and pdfs generated by that code, with each subfolder being a separate topic.

Admittedly, many are incomplete, but there's some potentially useful information contained within.
