### Philadelphia 

Some restaurants I like, with suggestions. 

#### University City

* __Koreana__: Hot pots
* __Bobby's Burger Palace__:Â Black and white milkshake
* __Pod__: Sushi and scallops.
* __Distrito__: Maybe a bit overpriced, but still good food.
* __Hub Bub__: Great coffee, usually Stumptown.
* __White Dog__: The type of restaurants parents love for dinner or brunch.
* __Han Dynasty__: Dan Dan noodles. Might not be the most authentic Szechuan if you're an expert, but if you're a Guailo like me, you won't know the difference and you'll like it. 

#### Broader West Philly

* __Abyssinia__: Ethiopian food.
* __Green Line Cafe__: Locust store better for doing work. Baltimore store better for a sunny day with a book.
* __Dock Street Brewery__

#### Center City

* __Reading Terminal Market__: One of my favorite spots in Philly.
    * __DiNic's__: Italian Pork Sandwich. Must now go on off times every since the Travel Channel got the word out.
    * __Herschel's__: My favorite pastrami sandwich, NY included.
    * __Termini Brothers__: Cannolis
    * __Bassetts__
* __Jake's Sandwich Board__: Great pork sandwiches with sriracha
* __Giorgio's on Pine__: Italian
* __Nan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodles__: Cheap, delicious noodles.
* __Terakawa Ramen__
* __Percy Street BBQ__
* __Pat's & Geno's__
* __Federal Donuts__

### New York

Grouped by food type; locations listed in description. Order only matters for some sections and will be noted. 

#### Coffee Shops 

My favorite coffee, ranked in descending order. Extra word if they have decent seating, a good setup, or other notable features.

* __Irving Farm Roasters__: UWS, and the one I frequent most. 
* __Birch Coffee__: Flatiron. Unfortunately their new place doesn't have the upstairs seating area/library the old one had, but their coffee is still top notch.
* __Blue Bottle Coffee__: Midtown, under 30 Rock. 
* __Think Coffee__: NYU.
* __Hungarian Pastry Shop__: Columbia. Great for sitting and parking with a book for a long while.
* __The Bean__: Union Square. Get the Frozen Mona Lisa in the summer.
* __Cafe Reggio__: Coffee was decent, but a really enjoyable place to sit in a great neighborhood. Maybe worth going to once. 

#### Pizza

Favorites ranked in descending order, but all of them are great.

* __Famous Joe's__: Greenwich Village. Take people here.
* __Pizza Italia__: Financial District. Grandma's slice. (Update: In a horrible twist both of fate and of the awful-food daggar in the Financial District's side, this has closed. It may be reopening, but I haven't found any good info.)
* __Motorino__: East Village. Sit down place. I had a meatball pizza there two years ago that I weirdly still think about sometimes.
* __Merilu Pizza al Metro__: Hell's Kitchen. Margherita style pizza.
* __Sacco's__: Hell's Kitchen.
* __Saluggi's__: Tribeca. Booth seating.
* __Patsy's__: NYU area. Sit down place.
* __Sal & Carmine's__: UWS. Salty pizza that makes you crave it.
* __Rizzo's__: Queens.
* __Artichoke's Pizza__: Greenwich Village. Probably overrated, but decent if you don't have overly high expectations. (But Famous Joe's is a block away and better. Go there.)
* __Freddy & Pepper's__: UWS.
* __Little Italy Pizza__: UWS.

#### Italian 

* __Pisillo Italian Panini__: Financial District, and it's best food option--period. Delicious sandwiches large enough for 1.5-2 meals.
* __La Lanterna di Vittorio__: Greenwich Village. Nice garden in the back.
* __Uva__: Upper East Side.
* __Pepolino__: Tribeca.
* __Da Andrea__: Union Square. Their flat buns and prosciutto appetizer was phenomenal.
* __Park Italian Gourmet__: Midtown. Great Italian sandwiches for lunch during the week. 
* __Piccoli Trattoria__: Park Slope.
* __Palma__: Greenwich Village. Mushroom and Fettuccine dish, with really outstanding, thin fettuccine. Garden seating in the back.


#### Bakeries, Pastries, Desserts

* __Levain Bakery__: UWS. My favorite place for dessert. Double chocolate chip combines the best parts of cookies and brownies.
* __Absolute Bagel__: UWS
* __Leo's Bagels__: Financial District.
* __Silvermoon Bakery__: UWS. California bun and brioche are excellent.
* __Bouchon Bakery__: UWS (kinda), or rather Columbus Circle, in the Time Warner Shopping Center. French pastries for you while everyone else is shopping, including really light, four inch tall chocolate croissants.
* __Eileen's Special Cheesecake__: SoHo. Individual sizes.
* __Breads Bakery__: Union Square. Very fresh top-notch pastries.
* __City Cakes__: Chelsea.
* __Gelato Ti Amo__: Financial District. Coffee and brandy gelato.


#### Asian

* __Prosperity Dumpling__: Chinatown.
* __Lam Zhou Noodle House__: Chinatown. Great divey noodle restaurant.
* __Momofuku Noodle Bar__: East Village.
* __Xi'an Famous__: East Village and Midtown. Pork buns and spicy noodle dishes.
* __Pure Thai Cookhouse__: Hell's Kitchen.


#### Misc

* __Lobster Place__: Chelsea Market. Whole lobsters and lobster bisque in a bread bowl.
* __Gray's Papaya__: UWS
* __Shake Shack__: Not enough places.
* __Pommes Frite__: East Village. A place that does strictly french fries. Go here.
